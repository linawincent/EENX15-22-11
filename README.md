# EENX15-22-11
This is an overview git of the Bachelor thesis project EENX15-22-11 from Chalmers University of Technology

The project is a further development of the K3lso-robot built by Robin Fr√∂jd on his Github simulation in pybullet and the characteristics of the robot are documented (https://github.com/raess1/K3lso-overview).

Implemented code on the robot is documented at: https://github.com/Pettssman/k3lso_A

Experimental test code is found at the repository: https://github.com/linawincent/k3lso_light

Simulations of control parameters are done in Simulink and stored in this repository.
